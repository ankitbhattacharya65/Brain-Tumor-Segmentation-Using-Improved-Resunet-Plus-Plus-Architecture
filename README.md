# **Brain Tumor Segmentation Using Improved ResUNet++ Architecture**
>  **A powerful deep learning model for precise brain tumor segmentation in MRI scans using an enhanced ResUNet++ architecture, outperforming 3D models with a lightweight 2D approach.**


---

This project presents an enhanced **ResUNet++ architecture** tailored for **brain tumor segmentation** from multimodal MRI scans. By breaking the task into **three binary 2D segmentation problems**—Whole Tumor (WT), Tumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET)—the model achieves superior precision while remaining computationally efficient. Key architectural improvements include **residual blocks**, **Squeeze-and-Excite modules**, and **Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP)**, enabling effective multi-scale feature extraction. Trained on the **BraTS 2020** dataset, the model delivers **Dice Scores of 0.9492 (WT), 0.9299 (TC), and 0.8895 (ET)**, outperforming several existing 3D models in segmentation accuracy and robustness.
