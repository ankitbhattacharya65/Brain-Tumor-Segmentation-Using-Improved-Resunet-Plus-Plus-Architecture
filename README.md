# **Brain Tumor Segmentation Using Improved ResUNet++ Architecture**
>  **A powerful deep learning model for precise brain tumor segmentation in MRI scans using an enhanced ResUNet++ architecture, outperforming 3D models with a lightweight 2D approach.**
> ## ðŸ§  Summary

This project presents an enhanced **ResUNet++ architecture** designed for **brain tumor segmentation** from multimodal MRI scans. The segmentation task is formulated as **three binary 2D segmentation problems**â€”Whole Tumor (WT), Tumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET)â€”enabling high precision with lower computational overhead. The architecture integrates **residual blocks**, **Squeeze-and-Excite modules**, **attention mechanisms**, and **Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP)** to capture rich contextual features at multiple scales. Trained on the **BraTS 2020** dataset, the model achieves remarkable **Dice Scores of 0.9492 (WT), 0.9299 (TC), and 0.8895 (ET)**, outperforming many existing 3D models in both accuracy and robustness.
